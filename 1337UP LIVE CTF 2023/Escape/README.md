# Solution

This was an unity game. We are trapped inside a box. The description tells us to escape from it. There are different ways to solve it. You can patch the file to double jump or fly, because it was an open box.
I used [cheatengine](https://www.cheatengine.org/) to teleport through the walls to the flag. Here you can watch the [solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgF4PQjeG-o)(it's from a different challenge but same solution). 

When teleported outside of box we can see another box, when we teleport in that box we can see the flag:
